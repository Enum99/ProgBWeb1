                <p class="blog-post-meta">See full article <a href="https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2021/07/22/blindness-wearable-device-accidents-study/8601626962178/">here</a> and the study <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2782065">here</a></p>
                <p>A study done by <cite><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2021.2624">JAMA Opthalmology</a></cite> developed a vision device designed to assist the blind and visually impared. Its goal is to reduce the number of accidents and collisions that happen in a daily basis for these groups</p>
                <p>By wearing the device and assisted with mobility aids (A long cane or a guide dog), it reduces the risk of collisions and falls by nearly 40% by analysing movements and objects in close proximity to the person.</p>
                <p>As Luo (an associate professor ofophthalmology at Harvard Medical School in Cambridge, Mass states: </p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote">
                  <p>"Many blind individuals use long canes to detect obstacles [and] collision risks are not completely eliminated. We sought to develop ... a device that can augment these everyday mobility aids, further improving their safety.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>The reason to develop this wearble camera is due to the downsides of the available mobility aids. For example a cane has a set maximum scanning range unable to extend it to detect potential collisions. A guide dog as well has to be trained and maintained in order to function as intended which the person may not have the time or in a good financial situation to have a dog.
                  The wearable camera can be supplemented with either of the mobility aids in order to reduce the impact of these limitations and decrease the chance of an accident occuring.
                </p>
                
                <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                <p>
                  The device works by having a data recording unit contained in a sling backpack where a chest mounted, wide-angle camera is attached on the strap. Then the user will wear two Bluetooth-connected wristbands.
                  The camera is connected to a processing unit which analyses the incoming data (objects that pose an incoming collision).
                </p>

                </div>

                <p>
                  If a risk is detected, a vibration will occur on the user's wrist whether the object is either on the right or left side of the user. For the case where a head-on collision is imminent both wristbands will vibrate. Any objects not on the users current course will be ignored.
                </p>

                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>
                  Participants in the study perfomed their daily activities with the device for a month. The device had two modes, an active and a silent mode. The active mode would vibrate incoming collusions as usual while silent mode still analysed incoming data, it didn't vibrate so the users don't know about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The silent mode acted as a double blind test so the wearers and researchers don't know when the device changed or not. To test if the device actually works, they compared the collisions between the different modes and found that 37% fewer collisions occured in the active mode compared to the silent mode.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                <p>
                  With the results, researchers want to dig deeper and improve the camera technology like it's robustness, size and make it more appealing to the user. According to Alex Bowers a study co-author wanted the camera to be an improvement compared to the cane while being the more affordable option then buying a guide dog.
