        <p class="blog-post-meta">November 2, 2022 by Enego</p>

        <p>One major positive impact of computing is all the peer support networks that are being created.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Before the inception of the internet, inorder to get help with any problem, many more people had to rely on expensive professionals. These professionals can be hard to access and in many cases there are not enough.</p>

        <p>Because of the internet (and computing as a whole) this has all changed.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Students can quickly receive constructive help from others with their work.</li>
          <li>Anyone suffering from a mental health condition can immediately speak to someone with lived experience.</li>
          <li>Customers can quickly gain a communal unbiased opinion of a business.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>In this article I will talk about a company for each of these points and how they benefit society.</p>
        <h2>
          Stack Overflow
        </h2>
        <p>If anyone is looking for a difficult or impossible task, then finding an experienced computer programmer who hasn't used stack overflow would be a good one.</p>
        <p>Stack overflow allows anyone, from anywhere in the world, to receive help with any programming problem. They make a post on the site and anyone can suggest a solution.</p>
        <p>This has made programming incredibly accessible for anyone. Anyone with access to the internet can access the website for no cost. This kind of company is only sustainable because it is so cheap to host a website that thousands of people are able to use to offer help.</p>


        <h2>Tellmi</h2>
        <p>Tellmi is a mental health app where anyone can make a post and talk about anything that is bothering them. Other users are then able to safely offer help and support.</p>
        <p>Before the creation of apps like Tellmi, anyone who needed support would need to pay for either an expensive counsellor, or be put on a waiting list for a free one. This is because there are simply not enough counsellors. However, through apps like Tellmi, anyone can anonymously ask others for help with more sensitive topics without having to feel embarrassed. And because there are many more people who have experienced mental health conditions than counsellors, the system is self-sustaining.</p>


        <h2>Trust Pilot</h2>
        <p>Trust pilot is a review site for businesses. Anyone can place reviews to inform others of their experience with the business.</p>
        <p>This means that anyone can be aware of how trustworthy any business is. For example, this Durham estate agent <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/morgandouglas.co.uk">Morgan Douglas</a> have a really bad set of reviews. Therefore people in durham looking for a house can know they might not want to live with them.</p>
