        <h2 class="blog-post-title">The Necessity of Piracy</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">November 1, 2022 by Charlie B</p>

        <h3>Digital Piracy is one of the positive effects Computer Science has had on society </h3>

        <p>
          Though this may sound counterintuitive at best and dubiously legal at worst, I truly
          believe that piracy has a net positive effect on society for a multitude of reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you would expect, piracy does hurt the upfront profits for publishers
          <a
            href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/09/eu-study-finds-piracy-doesnt-hurt-game-sales-may-actually-help/">
            though the magnitude of this has been disputed.
          </a>
          While this isn't great for the creators it is often the the publishers's own actions which makes piracy so
          attractive
          (excluding when consumers just want something for free).
        </p>

        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Always online DRM</strong> is an anti-piracy technique used in the games industry
          which requires the player to always be connected to the internet so the game / game console
          can verify if the player has the rights to use it.
        </p>
        <p>
          For users with an unstable internet connection this can make their game simply
          unplayable from their home. Even for consumers with strong internet connections it's not
          unheard of for the DRM servers to go down, making the game unusable for everyone who owns it.
          The only alternative for these people is to download a DRM-free version of the game which will
          often run both faster and smoother.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it wasn't for these DRM-free copies of the game then the games studio deciding to turn off
          the DRM servers a few years after release would make the game unplayable for the rest of time,
          which leads into my next point.
        </p>

        <h3>Archiving and preservation</h3>
        <p>
          In an era where most people stream media archiving content is more important than ever. Just
          recently HBO removed over
          <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/hbo-max-shows-removed-animation-infinity-train/">
            36 popular and HBO exclusive shows from it's streaming service.
          </a>
          These shows have also been removed from all online stores such as iTunes and Amazon making
          secondhand DVD prices skyrocket as the only legal way to watch them. This behavior has lead
          to some showrunners recommending piracy to anyone who wants to watch their show.   
        </p>
        <p>
          Before the dawn of personal VHS players Dr Who had a similar fate. To this day
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_missing_episodes">
            97 episodes
          </a>
          of the show are still missing. While it is likely many of these episodes are gone
          forever, the audio for every episode has been preserved through illegal fan recordings of
          the show.
